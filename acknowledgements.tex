First, I would like to thank my advisor, Lu\'{i}s Amaral, for his guidance, ideas, and support over this journey. He took a chance on an unknown student after one awkward phone call and for that I am forever grateful.

I would also thank my committee members, Neda Bagheri, Linda Broadbelt, and Brian Uzzi, for their valuable feedback and advice.

The Amaral Lab is an authentic idea factory encouraging open and serious discussions on science, statistics, silly movies, and everything in between. Many thanks to each and every ``Amaralian'' that have shared my stay in the lab.

To produce great science you need great teams. Thanks to my collaborators, Jordi Duch, Marta Sales-Pardo, Filippo Radicchi, Haroldo Ribeiro, and Teresa Woodruff for their many insights and suggestions. I would especially like to thank Xiaohan Zeng for the long discussions and his constant optimism, and Murielle Dunand who thought studying gender biases in movies would make for a \textit{short} summer project.

I could not have come to Northwestern without the financial support from the FCT-Portugal through PhD Studentship SFRH/BD/76115/2011.

Finally, I must thank my family for their unconditional love and support. Thanks to my parents, Margarida Pereira and Eliseo Moreira, for never second-guessing my decision to go to school in another continent. Thanks to my girlfriend, Emily Hanson, for all the cookies and pretzels, and for always being there for me. This is for all of you.
