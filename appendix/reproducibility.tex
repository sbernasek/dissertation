The work presented in this thesis is supported by large volumes of both experimental and simulated data. All of these datasets have been deposited along with their associated documentation in the Northwestern Arch data repository. See Table \ref{appendix:resources:data_repos} for a list of the available data.

In addition, all code used to analyze and visualize the data is publicly available via GitHub, mirrored between both \href{https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/}{my personal account} and the \href{https://github.com/amarallab}{Amaral} and \href{https://github.com/bagherilab}{Bagheri} lab accounts. Table \ref{appendix:resources:code_repos} lists the relevant repository for each chapter of this thesis, along with the software required to execute the corresponding code (see Appendix \ref{appendix:resources:software}). Each repository contains collections of Jupyter notebooks that walk users through the process of generating all of the figures presented in the corresponding chapter. Combined, these resources provide a  means to reproduce all of the results presented in both this thesis and the various manuscripts derived from it.
