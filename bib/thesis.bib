abstract = {Quantitative colocalization analysis is an advanced digital imaging tool to examine antigens of interest in immunofluorescence images obtained using confocal microscopes. It employs specialized algorithms to estimate the degree of overlap of fluorescence signals and thus enables acquiring important new information not otherwise obtainable using qualitative approaches alone. As raw confocal images have high levels of background, they should be prepared to become suitable for reliable calculation of colocalization coefficients by correcting it. We provide concise theoretical basis of quantitative colocalization analysis, discuss its limitations, and describe proper use of the technique. The use of quantitative colocalization analysis is demonstrated by studying bile salt export pump and multidrug resistance associated protein 2 in the liver and major basic protein and platelet activating factor receptor antigens in conjunctiva. The review is focused on the applicability and correct interpretation of the results of colocalization coefficients calculations.},

abstract = {Flow cytometric analysis allows rapid single cell interrogation of surface and intracellular determinants by measuring fluorescence intensity of fluorophore-conjugated reagents. The availability of new platforms, allowing detection of increasing numbers of cell surface markers, has challenged the traditional technique of identifying cell populations by manual gating and resulted in a growing need for the development of automated, high-dimensional analytical methods. We present a direct multivariate finite mixture modeling approach, using skew and heavy-tailed distributions, to address the complexities of flow cytometric analysis and to deal with high-dimensional cytometric data without the need for projection or transformation. We demonstrate its ability to detect rare populations, to model robustly in the presence of outliers and skew, and to perform the critical task of matching cell populations across samples that enables downstream analysis. This advance will facilitate the application of flow cytometry to new, complex biological and clinical problems.},

EBF and E2A synergistically upregulate transcription of endogenous B cell-specific genes in a non-B cell line. Here, we examine a genetic collaboration between these factors in regulating B lymphopoiesis. We find that Ebf(+/-)E2a(+/-) mice display a marked defect in pro-B cell differentiation at a stage later than observed in the single homozygous mutant mice. Pro-B cells from Ebf(+/-)E2a(+/-) mice show reduced expression of lymphoid-specific transcripts, including Pax5, Rag1, Rag2, and mb-1. We also show that EBF directly binds and activates the Pax5 promoter. Together, these data show collaboration between EBF and E2A and provide insight into the hierarchy of transcription factors that regulate B lymphocyte differentiation.},

Transcriptional activation by PPAR$\gamma$2 is potentiated by a variety of lipids and lipid-like compounds, including naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acids. We demonstrate here that retroviral expression of PPAR$\gamma$2 stimulates adipose differentiation of cultured fibroblasts. PPAR activators promote the differentiation of PPAR$\gamma$2-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner. C EBP$\alpha$, a second transcription factor induced during adipocyte differentiation, can cooperate with PPAR$\gamma$2 to stimulate the adipocyte program dramatically. Our results suggest that the physiologic role of PPAR$\gamma$2 is to regulate development of the adipose lineage in response to endogenous lipid activators and that this factor may serve to link the process of adipocyte differentiation to systemic lipid metabolism. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Integral feedback control is a basic engineering strategy for ensuring that the output of a system robustly tracks its desired value independent of noise or variations in system parameters. In biological systems, it is common for the response to an extracellular stimulus to return to its prestimulus value even in the continued presence of the signal-a process termed adaptation or desensitization. Barkai, Alon, Surette, and Leibler have provided both theoretical and experimental evidence that the precision of adaptation in bacterial chemotaxis is robust to dramatic changes in the levels and kinetic rate constants of the constituent proteins in this signaling network [Alon, U., Surette, M. G., Barkai, N. {\&} Leibler, S. (1998) Nature (London) 397, 168-171]. Here we propose that the robustness of perfect adaptation is the result of this system possessing the property of integral feedback control. Using techniques from control and dynamical systems theory, we demonstrate that integral control is structurally inherent in the Barkai-Leibler model and identify and characterize the key assumptions of the model. Most importantly, we argue that integral control in some form is necessary for a robust implementation of perfect adaptation. More generally, integral control may underlie the robustness of many homeostatic mechanisms.},

abstract = {ETS family transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved downstream effectors of Ras/MAPK signaling with critical roles in development and cancer. In Drosophila, the ETS repressor Yan regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in a variety of tissues; however, the mechanisms of Yan-mediated repression are not well understood and only a few direct target genes have been identified. Yan, like its human ortholog TEL1, self-associates through an N-terminal sterile $\alpha$-motif (SAM), leading to speculation that Yan/TEL1 polymers may spread along chromatin to form large repressive domains. To test this hypothesis, we created a monomeric form of Yan by recombineering a point mutation that blocks SAM-mediated self-association into the yan genomic locus and compared its genome-wide chromatin occupancy profile to that of endogenous wild-type Yan. Consistent with the spreading model predictions, wild-type Yan-bound regions span multiple kilobases. Extended occupancy patterns appear most prominent at genes encoding crucial developmental regulators and signaling molecules and are highly conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis, suggesting functional relevance. Surprisingly, although occupancy is reduced, the Yan monomer still makes extensive multikilobase contacts with chromatin, with an overall pattern similar to that of wild-type Yan. Despite its near-normal chromatin recruitment, the repressive function of the Yan monomer is significantly impaired, as evidenced by elevated target gene expression and failure to rescue a yan null mutation. Together our data argue that SAM-mediated polymerization contributes to the functional output of the active Yan repressive complexes that assemble across extended stretches of chromatin, but does not directly mediate recruitment to DNA or chromatin spreading.},

In dividing cells, it is required for growth but is not essential for cell cycle progression. In postmitotic cells, it promotes survival and subsequent differentiation of ommatidial cells. In the present paper, we have analyzed the different roles of Ras during eye development by using molecularly defined complete and partial loss-of-function mutations of Ras. We show that the three different functions of Ras are mediated by distinct thresholds of MAPK activity. Low MAPK activity prolongs cell survival and permits differentiation of R8 photoreceptor cells while high or persistent MAPK activity is sufficient to precociously induce R1-R7 photoreceptor differentiation in dividing cells.},

Computational image analysis has catalyzed this evolution, enabling rapid and automated processing of large datasets. Here, we review studies that combine time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis to investigate dynamic events at the single-cell level. We highlight examples where single-cell analysis provides unique mechanistic insights into cellular processes that cannot be otherwise resolved in bulk assays. Additionally, we discuss studies where quantitative microscopy facilitates the assembly of detailed 4D lineages in developing organisms.

abstract = {Starting with SAGE-libraries prepared from C. elegans FAC-sorted embryonic intestine cells (8E-16E cell stage), from total embryos and from purified oocytes, and taking advantage of the NextDB in situ hybridization data base, we define sets of genes highly expressed from the zygotic genome, and expressed either exclusively or preferentially in the embryonic intestine or in the intestine of newly hatched larvae; we had previously defined a similarly expressed set of genes from the adult intestine. We show that an extended TGATAA-like sequence is essentially the only candidate for a cis-acting regulatory motif common to intestine genes expressed at all stages. This sequence is a strong ELT-2 binding site and matches the sequence of GATA-like sites found to be important for the expression of every intestinal gene so far analyzed experimentally. We show that the majority of these three sets of highly expressed intestinal-specific/intestinal-enriched genes respond strongly to ectopic expression of ELT-2 within the embryo. By flow-sorting elt-2(null) larvae from elt-2(+) larvae and then preparing Solexa/Illumina-SAGE libraries, we show that the majority of these genes also respond strongly to loss-of-function of ELT-2. To test the consequences of loss of other transcription factors identified in the embryonic intestine, we develop a strain of worms that is RNAi-sensitive only in the intestine; however, we are unable (with one possible exception) to identify any other transcription factor whose intestinal loss-of-function causes a phenotype of comparable severity to the phenotype caused by loss of ELT-2. Overall, our results support a model in which ELT-2 is the predominant transcription factor in the post-specification C. elegans intestine and participates directly in the transcriptional regulation of the majority ({\textgreater} 80{\%}) of intestinal genes. We present evidence that ELT-2 plays a central role in most aspects of C. elegans intestinal physiology: establishing the structure of the enterocyte, regulating enzymes and transporters involved in digestion and nutrition, responding to environmental toxins and pathogenic infections, and regulating the downstream intestinal components of the daf-2/daf-16 pathway influencing aging and longevity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The crystalline photoreceptor lattice in the Drosophila eye is a paradigm for pattern formation during development. During eye development, activation of proneural genes at a moving front adds new columns to a regular lattice of R8 photoreceptors. We present a mathematical model of the governing activator-inhibitor system, which indicates that the dynamics of positive induction play a central role in the selection of certain cells as R8s. The "switch and template" patterning mechanism we observe is mathematically very different from the well-known Turing instability. Unlike a standard lateral inhibition model, our picture implies that R8s are defined before the appearance of the complete group of proneural cells. The model reproduces the full time course of proneural gene expression and accounts for specific features of the refinement of proneural groups that had resisted explanation. It moreover predicts that perturbing the normal template can lead to eyes containing stripes of R8 cells. We observed these stripes experimentally after manipulation of the Notch and scabrous genes. Our results suggest an alternative to the generally assumed mode of operation for lateral inhibition during development; more generally, they hint at a broader role for bistable switches in the initial establishment of patterns as well as in their maintenance.},

abstract = {Yan is an ETS-domain transcription factor responsible for maintaining Drosophila eye cells in a multipotent state. Yan is at the core of a regulatory network that determines the time and place in which cells transit from multipotency to one of several differentiated lineages. Using a fluorescent reporter for Yan expression, we observed a biphasic distribution of Yan in multipotent cells, with a rapid inductive phase and slow decay phase. Transitions to various differentiated states occurred over the course of this dynamic process, suggesting that Yan expression level does not strongly determine cell potential. Consistent with this conclusion, perturbing Yan expression by varying gene dosage had no effect on cell fate transitions. However, we observed that as cells transited to differentiation, Yan expression became highly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity was transient. Signals received via the EGF Receptor were necessary for the transience in Yan noise since genetic loss caused sustained noise. Since these signals are essential for eye cells to differentiate, we suggest that dynamic heterogeneity of Yan is a necessary element of the transition process, and cell states are stabilized through noise reduction.},

abstract = {Adult stem cells commonly give rise to transit-amplifying progenitors, whose progeny differentiate into distinct cell types. It is unclear if stem cell niche signals coordinate fate decisions within the progenitor pool. Here we use quantitative analysis of Wnt, Hh, and Notch signalling reporters and the cell fate markers Eyes Absent (Eya) and Castor (Cas) to study the effects of hyper-activation and loss of niche signals on progenitor development in the Drosophila ovary. Follicle stem cell (FSC) progeny adopt distinct polar, stalk, and main body cell fates. We show that Wnt signalling transiently inhibits expression of the main body cell fate determinant Eya, and Wnt hyperactivity strongly biases cells towards polar and stalk fates. Hh signalling independently controls the proliferation to differentiation transition. Notch is permissive but not instructive for differentiation of multiple cell types. These findings reveal that multiple niche signals coordinate cell fates and differentiation of progenitor cells.},

abstract = {The Drosophila EGF receptor is required for differentiation of many cell types during eye development. We have used mosaic analysis with definitive null mutations to analyze the effects of complete absence of EGFR, Ras or Raf proteins during eye development. The Egfr, ras and raf genes are each found to be essential for recruitment of R1-R7 cells. In addition Egfr is autonomously required for MAP kinase activation. EGFR is not essential for R8 cell specification, either alone or redundantly with any other receptor that acts through Ras or Raf, or by activating MAP kinase. As with Egfr, loss of ras or raf perturbs the spacing and arrangement of R8 precursor cells. R8 cell spacing is not affected by loss of argos in posteriorly juxtaposed cells, which rules out a model in which EGFR acts through argos expression to position R8 specification in register between adjacent columns of ommatidia. The R8 spacing role of the EGFR was partially affected by simultaneous deletion of spitz and vein, two ligand genes, but the data suggest that EGFR activation independent of spitz and vein is also involved. The results prove that R8 photoreceptors are specified and positioned by distinct mechanisms from photoreceptors R1-R7.},

We have isolated 13 top alleles in a screen for mutations failing to complement the female sterility of top, a recessive maternal effect allele that disrupts the establishment of the dorsoventral pattern of the egg shell and embryo. Several alleles recovered in this screen are zygotic lethal mutations; genetic analysis of these alleles has demonstrated that top is allelic to the embryonic lethal locus faint little ball. The 13 mutations recovered in our screens and 19 previously isolated top alleles have been genetically characterized through complementation tests with a series of hypomorphic and amorphic alleles. Nearly every top allele fails to complement the maternal effect sterility of top. Complementation tests show that the gene is required not only for oogenesis and embryogenesis, but also for pupal viability, for the growth of certain imaginal discs and for the patterning of specific ectodermal derivatives of the imaginal discs. Complementation analysis further demonstrates that the top lesions can be divided into general phenotypic categories: alleles affecting all gene activities in a coordinate manner, alleles preferentially affecting embryogenesis, alleles preferentially retaining oogenesis activity and alleles differentially affecting the development of specific imaginal disc derivatives. Correlations observed between the various developmental defects produced by top lesions suggest that the gene possesses several differentially, though not independently, mutable activities.},

abstract = {Cell-fate specification of R7 photoreceptors in the developing Drosophila eye depends on an inductive signal from neighbouring R8 cells. Mutations in three genes, sevenless (sev), bride-of-sevenless (boss) and seven-in-absentia (sina) cause the R7 precursor to become a non-neural cone cell. The sev gene encodes a receptor protein tyrosine kinase (Sev) localized on the R7 surface, activated by a boss-encoded ligand presented by R8. The sina gene encodes a nuclear factor required in R7. Reduction in the dosage of the Ras1 gene impairs Sev-mediated signalling, suggesting that activation of Ras1 may be an important consequence of Sev activation. We report here that Ras1 activation may account for all of the signalling action of Sev; an activated Ras1Va112 protein rescues the normal R7 precursor from transformation into a cone cell in sev and boss null mutants and induces the formation of supernumerary R7 cells. Similar activation of the Drosophila Ras2 protein does not produce these effects, demonstrating Ras protein specificity.},

abstract = {Drosophila brains contain numerous neurons that form complex circuits. These neurons are derived in stereotyped patterns from a fixed number of progenitors, called neuroblasts, and identifying individual neurons made by a neuroblast facilitates the reconstruction of neural circuits. An improved MARCM (mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker) technique, called twin-spot MARCM, allows one to label the sister clones derived from a common progenitor simultaneously in different colors. It enables identification of every single neuron in an extended neuronal lineage based on the order of neuron birth. Here we report the first example, to our knowledge, of complete lineage analysis among neurons derived from a common neuroblast that relay olfactory information from the antennal lobe (AL) to higher brain centers. By identifying the sequentially derived neurons, we found that the neuroblast serially makes 40 types of AL projection neurons (PNs). During embryogenesis, one PN with multi-glomerular innervation and 18 uniglomerular PNs targeting 17 glomeruli of the adult AL are born. Many more PNs of 22 additional types, including four types of polyglomerular PNs, derive after the neuroblast resumes dividing in early larvae. Although different offspring are generated in a rather arbitrary sequence, the birth order strictly dictates the fate of each post-mitotic neuron, including the fate of programmed cell death. Notably, the embryonic progenitor has an altered temporal identity following each self-renewing asymmetric cell division. After larval hatching, the same progenitor produces multiple neurons for each cell type, but the number of neurons for each type is tightly regulated. These observations substantiate the origin-dependent specification of neuron types. Sequencing neuronal lineages will not only unravel how a complex brain develops but also permit systematic identification of neuron types for detailed structure and function analysis of the brain.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel statistical approach that quantifies, for the first time, the amount of colocalization of two fluorescent-labeled proteins in an image automatically, removing the bias of visual interpretation. This is done by estimating simultaneously the maximum threshold of intensity for each color below which pixels do not show any statistical correlation. The sensitivity of the method was illustrated on simulated data by statistically confirming the existence of true colocalization in images with as little as 3{\%} colocalization. This method was then tested on a large three-dimensional set of fixed cells cotransfected with CFP/YFP pairs of proteins that either co-compartmentalized, interacted, or were just randomly localized in the nucleolus. In this test, the algorithm successfully distinguished random color overlap from colocalization due to either co-compartmentalization or interaction, and results were verified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The accuracy and consistency of our algorithm was further illustrated by measuring, for the first time in live cells, the dissociation rate (kd) of the HIV-1 Rev/CRM1 export complex induced by the cytotoxin leptomycin B. Rev/CRM1 colocalization in nucleoli dropped exponentially after addition of leptomycin B at a rate of 1.25 × 10 -3 s-1. More generally, this algorithm can be used to answer a variety of biological questions involving protein-protein interactions or co-compartmentalization and can be generalized to colocalization of more than two colors.},

abstract = {Coordination between cell proliferation and cell death is essential to maintain homeostasis in multicellular organisms. In Drosophila, these two processes are regulated by a pathway involving the Ste20-like kinase Hippo (Hpo) and the NDR family kinase Warts (Wts; also called Lats). Hpo phosphorylates and activates Wts, which in turn, through unknown mechanisms, negatively regulates the transcription of cell-cycle and cell-death regulators such as cycE and diap1. Here we identify Yorkie (Yki), the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP), as a missing link between Wts and transcriptional regulation. Yki is required for normal tissue growth and diap1 transcription and is phosphorylated and inactivated by Wts. Overexpression of yki phenocopies loss-of-function mutations of hpo or wts, including elevated transcription of cycE and diap1, increased proliferation, defective apoptosis, and tissue overgrowth. Thus, Yki is a critical target of the Wts/Lats protein kinase and a potential oncogene. Copyright {\textcopyright}2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Minutes comprise {\textgreater} 50 phenotypically similar mutations scattered throughout the genome of Drosophila, many of which are identified as mutations in ribosomal protein (rp) genes. Common traits of the Minute phenotype are short and thin bristles, slow development, and recessive lethality. By mobilizing a P element inserted in the 5' UTR of M(3)95A, the gene encoding ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), we have generated two homozygous viable heteroalleles that are partial revertants with respect to the Minute phenotype. Molecular characterization revealed both alleles to be imprecise excisions, leaving 40 and 110 bp, respectively, at the P-element insertion site. The weaker allele (40 bp insert) is associated with a approximately 15{\%} decrease in RPS3 mRNA abundance and displays a moderate Minute phenotype. In the stronger allele (110 bp insert) RPS3 mRNA levels are reduced by approximately 60{\%}, resulting in an extreme Minute phenotype that includes many morphological abnormalities as well as sterility in both males and females due to disruption of early gametogenesis. The results show that there is a correlation between reduced RPS3 mRNA levels and the severity of the Minute phenotype, in which faulty differentiation of somatic tissues and arrest of gametogenesis represent the extreme case. That heteroalleles in M(3)95A can mimic the phenotypic variations that exist between different Minute/rp-gene mutations strongly suggests that all phenotypes primarily are caused by reductions in maximum protein synthesis rates, but that the sensitivity for reduced levels of the individual rp-gene products is different.},

abstract = {With the realization that bacteria display phenotypic variability among cells and exhibit complex subcellular organization critical for cellular function and behavior, microscopy has re-emerged as a primary tool in bacterial research during the last decade. However, the bottleneck in today's single-cell studies is quantitative image analysis of cells and fluorescent signals. Here, we address current limitations through the development of Oufti, a stand-alone, open-source software package for automated measurements of microbial cells and fluorescence signals from microscopy images. Oufti provides computational solutions for tracking touching cells in confluent samples, handles various cell morphologies, offers algorithms for quantitative analysis of both diffraction and non-diffraction-limited fluorescence signals, and is scalable for high-throughput analysis of massive datasets, all with subpixel precision. All functionalities are integrated in a single package. The graphical user interface, which includes interactive modules for segmentation, image analysis, and post-processing analysis, makes the software broadly accessible to users irrespective of their computational skills.},

@article{Bush2016,
abstract = {According to receptor theory, the effect of a ligand depends on the amount of agonist-receptor complex. Therefore, changes in receptor abundance should have quantitative effects. However, the response to pheromone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is robust (unaltered) to increases or reductions in the abundance of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Ste2, responding instead to the fraction of occupied receptor. We found experimentally that this robustness originates during G-protein activation. We developed a complete mathematical model of this step, which suggested the ability to compute fractional occupancy depends on the physical interaction between the inhibitory regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS), Sst2, and the receptor. Accordingly, replacing Sst2 by the heterologous hsRGS4, incapable of interacting with the receptor, abolished robustness. Conversely, forcing hsRGS4:Ste2 interaction restored robustness. Taken together with other results of our work, we conclude that this GPCR pathway computes fractional occupancy because ligand-bound GPCR-RGS complexes stimulate signaling while unoccupied complexes actively inhibit it. In eukaryotes, many RGSs bind to specific GPCRs, suggesting these complexes with opposing activities also detect fraction occupancy by a ratiometric measurement. Such complexes operate as push-pull devices, which we have recently described.},

abstract = {The heat-shock protein Hsp90 supports diverse but specific signal transducers and lies at the interface of several developmental pathways. We report here that when Drosophila Hsp90 is mutant or pharmacologically impaired, phenotypic variation affecting nearly any adult structure is produced, with specific variants depending on the genetic background and occurring both in laboratory strains and in wild populations. Multiple, previously silent, genetic determinants produced these variants and, when enriched by selection, they rapidly became independent of the Hsp90 mutation. Therefore, widespread variation affecting morphogenic pathways exists in nature, but is usually silent; Hsp90 buffers this variation, allowing it to accumulate under neutral conditions. When Hsp90 buffering is compromised, for example by temperature, cryptic variants are expressed and selection can lead to the continued expression of these traits, even when Hsp90 function is restored. This provides a plausible mechanism for promoting evolutionary change in otherwise entrenched developmental processes.},

@article{Gillespie1977,
abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the “reaction-rate equations”); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the “master equation”). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this “stochastic simulation algorithm” correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

abstract = {In response to Wnt stimulation, $\beta$-catenin accumulates and activates target genes. Using modeling and experimental analysis, we found that the level of $\beta$-catenin is sensitive to perturbations in the pathway, such that cellular variation would be expected to alter the signaling outcome. One unusual parameter was robust: the fold-change in $\beta$-catenin level (post-Wnt/pre-Wnt). In Xenopus, dorsal-anterior development and target gene expression are robust to perturbations that alter the final level but leave the fold-change intact. These suggest, first, that despite cellular noise, the cell responds reliably to Wnt stimulation by maintaining a robust fold-change in $\beta$-catenin. Second, the transcriptional machinery downstream of the Wnt pathway does not simply read the $\beta$-catenin level after Wnt stimulation but computes fold-changes in $\beta$-catenin. Analogous to Weber's Law in sensory physiology, some gene transcription networks must respond to fold-changes in signals, rather than absolute levels, which may buffer stochastic, genetic, and environmental variation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Many mutations, including those that cause disease, only have a detrimental effect in a subset of individuals. The reasons for this are usually unknown, but may include additional genetic variation and environmental risk factors. However, phenotypic discordance remains even in the absence of genetic variation, for example between monozygotic twins, and incomplete penetrance of mutations is frequent in isogenic model organisms in homogeneous environments. Here we propose a model for incomplete penetrance based on genetic interaction networks. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, we identify two compensation mechanisms that vary among individuals and influence mutation outcome. First, feedback induction of an ancestral gene duplicate differs across individuals, with high expression masking the effects of a mutation. This supports the hypothesis that redundancy is maintained in genomes to buffer stochastic developmental failure. Second, during normal embryonic development we find that there is substantial variation in the induction of molecular chaperones such as Hsp90 (DAF-21). Chaperones act as promiscuous buffers of genetic variation, and embryos with stronger induction of Hsp90 are less likely to be affected by an inherited mutation. Simultaneously quantifying the variation in these two independent responses allows the phenotypic outcome of a mutation to be more accurately predicted in individuals. Our model and methodology provide a framework for dissecting the causes of incomplete penetrance. Further, the results establish that inter-individual variation in both specific and more general buffering systems combine to determine the outcome inherited mutations in each individual.},

abstract = {Divergent morphology of species has largely been ascribed to genetic differences in the tissue-specific expression of proteins, which could be achieved by divergence in cis-regulatory elements or by altering the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs). The relative importance of the latter has been difficult to assess, as previous systematic analyses of TF binding specificity have been performed using different methods in different species. To address this, we determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs, and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.},

abstract = {The dissociation constant for the binding of a spectroscopically invisible or non-radioactive ligand to its protein receptor can be determined in a competition experiment by using a structural analog that contains a reporter group. Many plotting and numerical analysis methods have been developed to calculate the binding constant of unlabeled ligand from the displacement experiments. However, a common problem with these plotting methods is that the equation transformations inevitably result in non-standard error distribution, and thus simple linear regression can not be used to extract correct values for the parameters. In the case of the numerical analysis methods, one would be faced with the possible existence of multiple solutions. In this paper, the exact mathematical expression for describing competitive binding of two different ligands to a protein molecule is presented in terms of the total concentrations of species in the system. Thus, using a commercially available non-linear regression program, all unknown parameters for describing this system can be determined by fitting the experimental data to the algebraically explicit equation without any data transformations. The distribution curves of all the species in the system can also be constructed with this equation. It is particularly useful for the cases in which the concentrations of all the species in the system are comparable to each other. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

We have explored the role of lineage restricted targets, using Drosophila, in order to better understand the evolutionary significance of microRNA-target relationships. From studies of two well characterized developmental regulatory networks, we find that miR-7 functions in several interlocking feedback and feedforward loops, and propose that its role in these networks is to buffer them against perturbation. To directly demonstrate this function for miR-7, we subjected the networks to temperature fluctuation and found that miR-7 is essential for the maintenance of regulatory stability under conditions of environmental flux. We suggest that some conserved microRNAs like miR-7 may enter into novel genetic relationships to buffer developmental programs against variation and impart robustness to diverse regulatory networks. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, the de-sign of increasingly sophisticated genetic tools over the last decades has added value to the use of imaginal discs as model systems. As a result of tissue-specific genetic screens, several components of developmentally regulated signaling pathways were identified and epistasis revealed the levels at which they function. Discs have been widely used to assess cellular inter-actions in their natural tissue context, contributing to a better understanding of growth regulation, tissue regeneration, and cancer. With the continuous implementation of novel tools, imaginal discs retain significant potential as model systems to address emerging questions in biology and medicine.},

Understanding the mechanisms that are responsible for this suppression is an important goal. Previously, we found that the microRNA miR-9a mitigates the impact of natural genetic variants that promote the development of scutellar bristles in adult Drosophila. Here we find that miR-9a does not affect the impact of genetic variants that inhibit the development of scutellar bristles. We show this using both directional and stabilizing selection in the laboratory. This specificity of action suggests that miR-9a does not interact with all functional classes of developmental genetic variants affecting sensory organ development. We also investigate the impact of miR-9a on a fitness trait, which is adult viability. At elevated physiological temperatures, miR-9a contributes to viability through masking genetic variants that hinder adult viability. We conclude that miR-9a activity in different developmental networks contributes to suppression of natural variants from perturbing development.},

Phosphorylation and downregulation of Yan is facilitated by a protein called Mae. Yan and Mae interact through their SAM domains. We find that repression by Yan requires the formation of a higher order structure mediated by Yan-SAM polymerization. Moreover, a crystal structure of the Yan-SAM/Mae-SAM complex shows that Mae-SAM specifically recognizes a surface on Yan-SAM that is also required for Yan-SAM polymerization. Mae-SAM binds to Yan-SAM with ∼1000-fold higher affinity than Yan-SAM binds to itself and can effectively depolymerize Yan-SAM. Mutations on Mae that specifically disrupt its SAM domain-dependent interactions with Yan disable the derepression function of Mae in vivo. Depolymerization of Yan by Mae represents a novel mechanism of transcriptional control that sensitizes Yan for regulation by receptor tyrosine kinases.},

Both of these subgroups are determined in the germarium, and both cease division early in oogenesis. To test the possibility that these subgroups are related by lineage, we generated dominantly marked mitotic clones in ovaries. Small, restricted clones in stalk cells and polar cells were found adjacent to each other at a frequency much too high to be explained by independent induction. We therefore propose a model in which stalk cells and polar cells are derived from a precursor population that is distinct from the precursors for other follicle cells. We support and extend this model by characterization of mutants that affect stalk and polar cell formation. We find that ectopic expression of Hedgehog can induce both polar and stalk cell fate, presumably by acting on the precursor stage. In contrast, we find that stall affects neither the induction of the precursors nor the decision between the stalk cell and polar cell fate but, rather, some later differentiation step of stalk cells. In addition, we show that ectopic polar and stalk cells disturb the anterior-posterior polarity of the underlying oocyte.},

We report here the DNA-binding profiles for all human and mouse ETS factors, which we generated using two different methods: a high-throughput microwell-based TF DNA-binding specificity assay, and protein-binding microarrays (PBMs). Both approaches reveal that the ETS-binding profiles cluster into four distinct classes, and that all ETS factors linked to cancer, ERG, ETV1, ETV4 and FLI1, fall into just one of these classes. We identify amino-acid residues that are critical for the differences in specificity between all the classes, and confirm the specificities in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for a member of each class.

The other locus encodes a protein that is homologous to the S. cerevisiae CDC25 protein, an activator of guanine nucleotide exchange by ras proteins.

Flybow combines the Gal4-upstream activating sequence binary system to regulate transgene expression and an inducible modified Flp-FRT system to drive inversions and excisions of cassettes. This provides spatial and temporal control over the stochastic expression of one of two or four reporters within one sample. Using the visual system, the embryonic nervous system and the wing imaginal disc, we show that Flybow in conjunction with specific Gal4 drivers can be used to visualize cell morphology with high resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that this labeling approach is compatible with available Flp-FRT-based techniques, such as mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker; this could further support the genetic analysis of neural circuit assembly and function.},

abstract = {A critical question about signal transduction is how weak or transient activation of signaling pathways achieves a robust and long-term switch in gene expression. We report that a microRNA is part of a mechanism that makes cells sensitive to signals in the Drosophila eye. Expression of miR-7 is activated in cells as they begin differentiating into photoreceptors. This is dependent on EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling that triggers ERK-mediated degradation of the transcription factor Yan. In nonstimulated cells, Yan represses miR-7 transcription, whereas miR-7 RNA represses Yan protein expression in photoreceptors, by binding to sequences within its mRNA 3′UTR. We propose that reciprocal negative feedback between Yan and miR-7 ensures mutually exclusive expression, with Yan in progenitor cells and miR-7 in photoreceptor cells. Expression is switched when EGFR signaling transiently triggers Yan degradation. This two-tiered mechanism explains how signal transduction activity can robustly generate a stable change in gene-expression patterns. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Inc.},

But with the rapid growth of the discipline and the many advances made over the past seven years, it's time to bring this standard-setting reference up to date.Editors Jacob E. Goodman and Joseph O'Rourke reassembled their stellar panel of contributors, added manymore, and together thoroughly revised their work to make the most important results and methods, both classic and cutting-edge, accessible in one convenient volume. Now over more then 1500 pages, the Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry, Second Edition once again provides unparalleled, authoritative coverage of theory, methods, and applications.Highlights of the Second Edition: Thirteen new chapters: Five on applications and others on collision detection, nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces, curve and surface reconstruction, embeddings of finite metric spaces, polygonal linkages, the discrepancy method, and geometric graph theory Thorough revisions of all remaining chapters Extended coverage of computational geometry software, now comprising two chapters: one on the LEDA and CGAL libraries, the other on additional software Two indices: An Index of Defined Terms and an Index of Cited Authors Greatly expanded bibliographies},

abstract = {During development of the adult Drosophila visual system, axons of the eight photoreceptors in each ommatidium fasciculate together and project as a single bundle towards the optic lobes of the brain. Within the brain, individual photoreceptor axons from each bundle then seek specific targets in distinct layers of the optic lobes. The axons of photoreceptors R1-R6 terminate in the lamina, while R7 and R8 axons pass through the lamina to terminate in separate layers of the medulla. To identify genes required for photoreceptor axon guidance, including those with essential functions during early development, we have devised a strategy for the simple and efficient generation of genetic mosaics in which mutant photoreceptor axons innervate a predominantly wild-type brain. In a large-scale saturation mutagenesis performed using this system, we recovered new alleles of the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP69D. PTP69D has previously been shown to function in the correct targeting of motor axons in the embryo and R1-R6 axons in the visual system. Here, we show that PTP69D is also required for correct targeting of R7 axons. Whereas mutant R1-R6 axons occasionally extend beyond their normal targets in the lamina, mutant R7 axons often fail to reach their targets in the medulla, stopping instead at the same level as the R8 axon. These targeting errors are difficult to reconcile with models in which PTP69D plays an instructive role in photoreceptor axon targeting, as previously proposed. Rather, we suggest that PTP69D plays a permissive role, perhaps reducing the adhesion of R1-R6 and R7 growth cones to the pioneer R8 axon so that they can respond independently to their specific targeting cues.},

Here we present evidence that Sternopleural (Sp) is another regulatory allele of wg that affects a subset of larval functions. Sp has both a recessive loss-of-function component and a gain-of-function component. The loss-of-function component reflects a reduction of wg activity in the notum and in the antenna. The gain-of-function component apparently leads to ectopic wg activity in the dorsal first and second leg disc and thereby generates the dominant Sp phenotype. Sp and other wg alleles show a complex pattern of complementation. We present evidence that these genetic properties are due to transvection. These results have implications for the genetic definition of a null allele at loci subject to transvection.},

abstract = {Background: The receptor protein Notch plays a conserved role in restricting neural-fate specification during lateral inhibition. Lateral inhibition requires the Notch intracellular domain to coactivate Su(H)-mediated transcription of the Enhancer-of-split Complex. During Drosophila eye development, Notch plays an additional role in promoting neural fate independently of Su(H) and E(spl)-C, and this finding suggests an alternative mechanism of Notch signal transduction. Results: We used genetic mosaics to analyze the proneural enhancement pathway. As in lateral inhibition, the metalloprotease Kuzbanian, the EGF repeat 12 region of the Notch extracellular domain, Presenilin, and the Notch intracellular domain were required. By contrast, proneural enhancement became constitutive in the absence of Su(H), and this led to premature differentiation and upregulation of the Atonal and Senseless proteins. Ectopic Notch signaling by Delta expression ahead of the morphogenetic furrow also caused premature differentiation. Conclusions: Proneural enhancement and lateral inhibition use similar ligand binding and receptor processing but differ in the nuclear role of Su(H). Prior to Notch signaling, Su(H) represses neural development directly, not indirectly through E(spl)-C. During proneural enhancement, the Notch intracellular domain overcomes the repression of neural differentiation. Later, lateral inhibition restores the repression of neural development by a different mechanism, requiring E(spl)-C transcription. Thus, Notch restricts neurogenesis temporally to a narrow time interval between two modes of repression.},

The advanced genetic toolkit of Drosophila makes it possible to label molecular and cellular components with unprecedented level of specificity necessitating the application of the most sophisticated imaging technologies. Imaging in Drosophila spans all scales from single molecules to the entire populations of adult organisms, from electron microscopy to live imaging of developmental processes. As the imaging approaches become more complex and ambitious, there is an increasing need for quantitative, computer-mediated image processing and analysis to make sense of the imagery. Bioimage Informatics is an emerging research field that covers all aspects of biological image analysis from data handling, through processing, to quantitative measurements, analysis and data presentation. Some of the most advanced, large scale projects, combining cutting edge imaging with complex bioimage informatics pipelines, are realized in the Drosophila research community. In this review, we discuss the current research in biological image analysis specifically relevant to the type of systems level image datasets that are uniquely available for the Drosophila model system. We focus on how state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms are impacting the ability of Drosophila researchers to analyze biological systems in space and time. We pay particular attention to how these algorithmic advances from computer science are made usable to practicing biologists through open source platforms and how biologists can themselves participate in their further development. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Users are guided through results by a simple interface at a level of detail they determine. This protocol will guide users from submitting a protein sequence to interpreting the secondary and tertiary structure of their models, their domain composition and model quality. A range of additional available tools is described to find a protein structure in a genome, to submit large number of sequences at once and to automatically run weekly searches for proteins that are difficult to model.

abstract = {The acquisition of cellular identity during development depends on precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression, with combinatorial interactions between transcription factors, accessory proteins and the basal transcription machinery together translating complex signaling inputs into appropriate gene expression outputs. The opposing repressive and activating inputs of the Drosophila ETS family transcription factors Yan and Pointed orchestrate numerous cell fate transitions downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, providing one of the premier systems for studying this process. Current models describe the differentiative transition as a switch from Yan-mediated repression to Pointed-mediated activation of common target genes. We describe here a new layer of regulation whereby Yan and Pointed co-occupy regulatory elements to repress gene expression in a coordinated manner, with Pointed being unexpectedly required for the genome-wide occupancy of both Yan and the co-repressor Groucho. Using even skipped as a test-case, synergistic genetic interactions between Pointed, Groucho, Yan and components of the RNA polymerase II pausing machinery suggest that Pointed integrates multiple scales of repressive regulation to confer robustness. We speculate that this mechanism may be used broadly to fine-tune the expression of many genes crucial for development.},

We identify the proneural gene achaete (ac) as a direct downstream target of h regulation in vivo. Mutation of a single, evolutionarily conserved, high-affinity h binding site in the upstream region of ac results in the appearance of ectopic sensory organs in adult flies, in a pattern that strongly resembles the phenotype of h mutants. This indicates that direct repression of ac by h plays an essential role in pattern formation in the PNS. Our results demonstrate that HLH proteins negatively regulate ac transcription by at least two distinct mechanisms.},

abstract = {Here we studied the quantitative behaviour and cell-to-cell variability of a prototypical eukaryotic cell-fate decision system, the mating pheromone response pathway in yeast. We dissected and measured sources of variation in system output, analysing thousands of individual, genetically identical cells. Only a small proportion of total cell-to-cell variation is caused by random fluctuations in gene transcription and translation during the response ('expression noise'). Instead, variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of individual cells to transmit signals through the pathway ('pathway capacity') and to express proteins from genes ('expression capacity'). Cells with high expression capacity express proteins at a higher rate and increase in volume more rapidly. Our results identify two mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell variation in pathway capacity. First, the MAP kinase Fus3 suppresses variation at high pheromone levels, while the MAP kinase Kss1 enhances variation at low pheromone levels. Second, pathway capacity and expression capacity are negatively correlated, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that allows cells to respond more precisely to pheromone in the presence of a large variation in expression capacity.},

Although significant progress has been made in dissecting the acquisition of ;eye identity' at the transcriptional level, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from neuronal progenitor to differentiating neuron remain unclear. A recently proposed model for the integration of organ specification and neurogenesis hypothesizes that atonal expression in the eye is RD-network-independent and that Eyeless works in parallel or downstream of atonal to modify the neurogenetic program. We show here that distinct cis-regulatory elements control atonal expression specifically in the eye and that the RD factors Eyeless and Sine oculis function as direct regulators. We find that these transcription factors interact in vitro and provide indirect evidence that this interaction may be required in vivo. The subordination of neurogenesis to the RD pathway in the eye provides a direct mechanism for the coordination of neurogenesis and tissue specification during sensory organ formation.},

abstract = {Many sensory systems (e.g., vision and hearing) show a response that is proportional to the fold-change in the stimulus relative to the background, a feature related to Weber's Law. Recent experiments suggest such a fold-change detection feature in signaling systems in cells: a response that depends on the fold-change in the input signal, and not on its absolute level. It is therefore of interest to find molecular mechanisms of gene regulation that can provide such fold-change detection. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that fold-change detection can be generated by one of the most common network motifs in transcription networks, the incoherent feedforward loop (I1-FFL), in which an activator regulates both a gene and a repressor of the gene. The fold-change detection feature of the I1-FFL applies to the entire shape of the response, including its amplitude and duration, and is valid for a wide range of biochemical parameters. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Traditional methods for flow cytometry (FCM) data processing rely on subjective manual gating. Recently, several groups have developed computational methods for identifying cell populations in multidimensional FCM data. The Flow Cytometry: Critical Assessment of Population Identification Methods (FlowCAP) challenges were established to compare the performance of these methods on two tasks: (i) mammalian cell population identification, to determine whether automated algorithms can reproduce expert manual gating and (ii) sample classification, to determine whether analysis pipelines can identify characteristics that correlate with external variables (such as clinical outcome). This analysis presents the results of the first FlowCAP challenges. Several methods performed well as compared to manual gating or external variables using statistical performance measures, which suggests that automated methods have reached a sufficient level of maturity and accuracy for reliable use in FCM data analysis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {PU.1 is an Ets family transcription factor that is essential for fetal liver hematopoiesis. We have generated a PU.1gfp reporter strain that allowed us to examine the expression of PU.1 in all hematopoietic cell lineages and their early progenitors. Within the bone marrow progenitor compartment, PU.1 is highly expressed in the hematopoietic stem cell, the common lymphoid progenitor, and a proportion of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs). Based on Flt3 and PU.1 expression, the CMP could be divided into three subpopulations, Flt3+ PU.1hi, Flt3− PU.1hi, and Flt3− PU.1lo CMPs. Colony-forming assays and in vivo lineage reconstitution demonstrated that the Flt3+ PU.1hi and Flt3− PU.1hi CMPs were efficient precursors for granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), whereas the Flt3− PU.1lo CMPs were highly enriched for committed megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs). CMPs have been shown to rapidly differentiate into GMPs and MEPs in vitro. Interestingly, short-term culture revealed that the Flt3+ PU.1hi and Flt3− PU.1hi CMPs rapidly became CD16/32high (reminiscent of GMPs) in culture, whereas the Flt3− PU.1lo CMPs were the immediate precursors of the MEP. Thus, down-regulation of PU.1 expression in the CMP is the first molecularly identified event associated with the restriction of differentiation to erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages.},

abstract = {Segmentation is the process of partitioning digital images into meaningful regions. The analysis of biological high content images often requires segmentation as a first step. We propose ilastik as an easy-to-use tool which allows the user without expertise in image processing to perform segmentation and classification in a unified way. ilastik learns from labels provided by the user through a convenient mouse interface. Based on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation. A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier. An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of representative images, it can be exported and used to automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using the CellProfiler pipeline). ilastik is an open source project and released under the BSD license at www.ilastik.org.},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis of mosaic tissues is a powerful method for following developmental lineages; however, analytical techniques are often subjective and repetitious. Here a flexible, semi-automated image analysis method for mosaic patterns is described. ClonalTools is a free customizable tool-set designed for the open-source image analysis package ImageJ. Circular, polygonal or linear one-dimensional mosaic arrays can be interrogated to provide measurements of the total number and width of positive and negative patches in a region of interest. These results are adjusted for the effects of random clumping using a previously described method to correct for differences in the contribution of the positive and negative cell type. The applicability of ClonalTools to different systems is discussed with reference to the analysis of mosaic patterns in the mouse corneal epithelium and adrenal cortex and in the outgrowth of neurites from explant cultures of mouse retina as example systems. To validate ClonalTools quantitatively, a recently published manual clonal analysis of the corneal epithelium of X-inactivation beta-Gal-mosaic mice was re-analysed. The semi-automated results did not differ significantly from the published data. Rapid quantification of such patterns to produce biologically relevant results represents a welcome improvement in terms of ease and speed of use over previous methods.},

Cell types are specified sequentially by separate episodes of EGFR activity. All the cell types differentiate in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Before differentiating, many cells pass through the cell cycle in the "Second Mitotic Wave" in response to Notch activity, but no cell fates are specified during the Second Mitotic Wave. It is not known how fate specification is limited to G1-arrested cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Competence to differentiate in response to activated RasV12 was diminished during the Second Mitotic Wave accounting for the failure to recruit cell fates from cycling cells. Competence was not restored by blocking cell cycle progression, but was restored by reduced Notch activity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Competence to differentiate does not depend on cell cycle progression per se, but on the same receptor activity that also induces cell cycle entry. Dual effects of Notch on the cell cycle and on differentiation help ensure that only G1 phase cells undergo fate specification.},

abstract = {In most tissues, cell division is coordinated with increases in mass (i.e., growth). To understand this coordination, we altered rates of division in cell clones or compartments of the Drosophila wing and measured the effects on growth. Constitute overproduction of the transcriptional regulator dE2F increased expression of the S- and M-phase initiators Cyclin E and String (Cdc25), thereby accelerating cell proliferation. Loss of dE2F or overproduction of its corepressor, RBF, retarded cell proliferation. These manipulations altered cell numbers over a 4- to 5-fold range but had little effect on clone or compartment sizes. Instead, changes in cell division rates were offset by changes in cell sizes. We infer that dE2F and RBF function specifically in cell control, and that cell cycle acceleration is insufficient to stimulate growth. Variations in dE2F activity could be used to coordinate cell division with growth.},

For example, in the latter case, 0.5{\%}-1{\%} of the human genome is typically variable between any two unrelated individuals. Such diversity might create problematic variability in the activity of gene regulatory networks and, ultimately, in cell behaviors. Using multigenerational selection experiments, we find that for the Drosophila proneural network, the effect of genomic diversity is dampened by miR-9a-mediated regulation of senseless expression. Reducing miR-9a regulation of the Senseless transcription factor frees the genomic landscape to exert greater phenotypic influence. Whole-genome sequencing identified genomic loci that potentially exert such effects. A larger set of sequence variants, including variants within proneural network genes, exhibits these characteristics when miR-9a concentration is reduced. These findings reveal that microRNA-target interactions may be a key mechanism by which the impact of genomic diversity on cell behavior is dampened. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Phenotypic and complementation analysis revealed that aop is allelic to yan and genetically the lethal alleles act as null mutations for the yan gene. Analysis of the lethal alleles in the embryo and in mitotic clones showed that loss of yan function causes cells to overproliferate in the dorsal neuroectoderm of the embryo and in the developing eye disc. Our studies suggest that the role of yan is defined by the developmental context of the cells in which it functions.

abstract = {The Drosophila eye is widely used as a model for studies of development and neuronal degeneration. With the powerful mitotic recombination technique, elegant genetic screens based on clonal analysis have led to the identification of signaling pathways involved in eye development and photoreceptor (PR) differentiation at larval stages. We describe here the Tomato/GFP-FLP/FRT method, which can be used for rapid clonal analysis in the eye of living adult Drosophila. Fluorescent photoreceptor cells are imaged with the cornea neutralization technique, on retinas with mosaic clones generated by flipase-mediated recombination. This method has several major advantages over classical histological sectioning of the retina: it can be used for high-throughput screening and has proved an effective method for identifying the factors regulating PR survival and function. It can be used for kinetic analyses of PR degeneration in the same living animal over several weeks, to demonstrate the requirement for specific genes for PR survival or function in the adult fly. This method is also useful for addressing cell autonomy issues in developmental mutants, such as those in which the establishment of planar cell polarity is affected.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analyzing spatial distributions of objects in images is a fundamental task in many biological studies. The relative arrangement of a set of objects with respect to another set of objects contains information about potential interactions between the two sets of objects. If they do not "feel" each other's presence, their spatial distributions are expected to be independent of one another. Spatial correlations in their distributions are indicative of interactions and can be modeled by an effective interaction potential acting between the points of the two sets. This can be used to generalize co-localization analysis to spatial interaction analysis. However, no user-friendly software for this type of analysis was available so far.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present an ImageJ/Fiji plugin that implements the complete workflow of spatial pattern and interaction analysis for spot-like objects. The plugin detects objects in images, infers the interaction potential that is most likely to explain the observed pattern, and provides statistical tests for whether an inferred interaction is significant given the number of objects detected in the images and the size of the space within which they can distribute. We benchmark and demonstrate the present software using examples from confocal and PALM single-molecule microscopy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The present software greatly simplifies spatial interaction analysis for point patterns, and makes it available to the large user community of ImageJ and Fiji. The presented showcases illustrate the usage of the software.},

Here, we introduce a live-cell reporter for the pluripotency factor OCT4 into human embryonic stem cells to understand how they choose between self-renewal and differentiation. By tracing the histories of individual cells over multiple generations, we found that cells whose offspring were destined to differentiate showed decreased expression of OCT4 long before exposure to the differentiation stimulus. OCT4 levels were lineage-dependent; however, during cell division, mother cells distributed OCT4 asymmetrically to daughters. The resulting ratio of OCT4 between sister cells — established within minutes of mitosis — was predictive of downstream fates: cells receiving a greater ratio of maternal OCT4 showed sustained OCT4 levels and a reduced capacity to differentiate. Our observations imply that the choice between two developmental fates is almost entirely predetermined at the time of cell birth through inheritance of a pluripotency factor.},

Our results indicate that sevenless gene function is only required during a brief, defined period for the initiation of R7 development; subsequently sevenless is dispensable for both differentiation and function of the R7 photo-receptors.

Osf2/Cbfa1 expression is initiated in the mesenchymal condensations of the developing skeleton, is strictly restricted to cells of the osteoblast lineage thereafter, and is regulated by BMP7 and vitamin D3. Osf2/Cbfa1 binds to and regulates the expression of multiple genes expressed in osteoblasts. Finally, forced expression of Osf2/Cbfa1 in nonosteoblastic cells induces the expression of the principal osteoblast- specific genes.

Second, the transcription factor NF-IL6 was also found to be required for the activation of the human IL-4 promoter in a Th2 clone, via the positive regulatory element 1 (PRE-1) of the human IL-4 promoter (Davydov et al., 1995). However, the selective expres-sion of these two transcription factors was observed in fully differentiated Th2 cells. Their roles in the differentia-tion of Th2 cells from naive precursors are less clear. In addition, the regulation of the expression of other Th2 cytokine genes by these factors has not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, although much has been known about the regulation of the IL-4 gene promoter, our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms leading to the development of the Th2 phenotype remains lim-ited. We have recently shown that IL-6, which activates NF-IL6, can stimulate IL-4 production by CD4 T cells, providing a mechanism whereby APC could direct Th2 differentiation through the NF-IL6 family (Rinc{\'{o}} n et al., 1997a).

abstract = {The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway comprises multiple ligands and receptors that interact promiscuously with one another and typically appear in combinations. This feature is often explained in terms of redundancy and regulatory flexibility, but it has remained unclear what signal-processing capabilities it provides. Here, we show that the BMP pathway processes multi-ligand inputs using a specific repertoire of computations, including ratiometric sensing, balance detection, and imbalance detection. These computations operate on the relative levels of different ligands and can arise directly from competitive receptor-ligand interactions. Furthermore, cells can select different computations to perform on the same ligand combination through expression of alternative sets of receptor variants. These results provide a direct signal-processing role for promiscuous receptor-ligand interactions and establish operational principles for quantitatively controlling cells with BMP ligands. Similar principles could apply to other promiscuous signaling pathways.},

Here, we demonstrate that together with the transcription factor Lozenge, the nuclear effectors of the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways directly regulate D-Pax2 transcription in cone cells of the Drosophila eye disc. Moreover, the specificity of D-Pax2 expression can be altered upon genetic manipulation of these inputs. Thus, a relatively small number of temporally and spatially controlled signals received by a set of pluripotent cells can create the unique combinations of activated transcription factors required to regulate target genes and ultimately specify distinct cell fates within this group. We expect that similar mechanisms may specify pattern formation in vertebrate developmental systems that involve intercellular communication.},

abstract = {In the Drosophila optic lobes, 800 retinotopically organized columns in the medulla act as functional units for processing visual information. The medulla contains over 80 types of neuron, which belong to two classes: uni-columnar neurons have a stoichiometry of one per column, while multi-columnar neurons contact multiple columns. Here we show that combinatorial inputs from temporal and spatial axes generate this neuronal diversity: all neuroblasts switch fates over time to produce different neurons; the neuroepithelium that generates neuroblasts is also subdivided into six compartments by the expression of specific factors. Uni-columnar neurons are produced in all spatial compartments independently of spatial input; they innervate the neuropil where they are generated. Multi-columnar neurons are generated in smaller numbers in restricted compartments and require spatial input; the majority of their cell bodies subsequently move to cover the entire medulla. The selective integration of spatial inputs by a fixed temporal neuroblast cascade thus acts as a powerful mechanism for generating neural diversity, regulating stoichiometry and the formation of retinotopy.},

abstract = {The phenotypic differences between individual organisms can often be ascribed to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical organisms in homogeneous environments vary, indicating that randomness in developmental processes such as gene expression may also generate diversity. To examine the consequences of gene expression variability in multicellular organisms, we studied intestinal specification in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which wild-type cell fate is invariant and controlled by a small transcriptional network. Mutations in elements of this network can have indeterminate effects: some mutant embryos fail to develop intestinal cells, whereas others produce intestinal precursors. By counting transcripts of the genes in this network in individual embryos, we show that the expression of an otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable in the mutants and that this variation is subjected to a threshold, producing an ON/OFF expression pattern of the master regulatory gene of intestinal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that mutations in developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability in gene expression, leading to pronounced phenotypic variation.},

Binding of the cell-specific Lozenge protein is also required for activation, and overlapping Lozenge protein distribution and DER signaling establishes expression in a subset of equivalent cells competent to respond to Sevenless.

abstract = {It is now clear that resident myofibroblasts play a central role in the mediation of tissue fibrosis. The aim of the work outlined in this study is to increase our understanding of the mechanisms which drive the phenotypic and functional changes associated with the differentiation process. We have used an in vitro model of transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1)-induced pulmonary fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation to examine the role of the TGF-$\beta$1 Smad protein signaling intermediates, in alterations of fibroblast phenotype and function associated with terminal differentiation. TGF-$\beta$1 induced marked alteration in cell phenotype, such that cells resembled "epithelioid-postmitotic fibroblasts." This was associated with marked reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and upregulation of $\alpha$SMA gene expression. TGF-$\beta$1 stimulation also induced $\alpha$SMA protein expression with increased incorporation of $\alpha$SMA into stress fibers. Following stimulation with TGF-$\beta$1, subsequent addition of serum-free medium did not reverse TGF-$\beta$1-induced morphological change, suggesting that TGF-$\beta$1 induced a relatively stable alteration in fibroblast cell phenotype. Functionally, these phenotypic changes were associated with induction of type I, type III, and type IV collagen gene expression and an increase in the concentrations of the respective collagens in the cell culture supernatant. The role of Smad proteins in terminal differentiation of fibroblasts was examined by transfection of cells, with expression vectors for the TGF$\beta$1 receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) or the co-Smad, Smad 4. Transfection with Smad2 but not Smad3 resulted in TGF-$\beta$1 independent alteration in fibroblast cell phenotype, up-regulation of $\alpha$SMA mRNA and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Transfection with Smad4 also induced alteration in cell phenotype, although this was not as pronounced as the effect of overexpression of Smad2. Overexpression of the Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 proteins was associated with increased production of all collagen types. The study suggests that the phenotypic and functional changes associated with TGF-$\beta$1-induced fibroblast terminal differentiation are differentially regulated by Smad proteins. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

However, the dependence of the FLP-FRT method on cell division, and other constraints, also impose limits on its effectiveness. We describe here the generation and testing of tools for Mutant Analysis by Rescue Gene Excision (MARGE), an approach whereby mutant cells are formed by loss of a rescue transgene in a homozygous mutant organism. Rescue-transgene loss can be induced in any tissue or cell-type and at any time during development or in the adult using available heat-shock-induced or tissue-specific flippases, or combinations of UAS-FLP with Gal4 and Gal80(ts) reagents. The simultaneous loss of a constitutive fluorescence marker (GFP or RFP) identifies the mutant cells. We demonstrate the efficacy of the MARGE technique by flip-out (clonal and disc-wide) of a Ubi-GFP-carrying construct in imaginal discs, and by inducing a known yki mutant phenotype in the Drosophila ovary.},

abstract = {The ETS family transcriptional repressor Yan is an important downstream target and effector of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. Structural and biochemical studies have shown that the N-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) of Yan is able to self associate to form a helical polymeric structure in vitro, although the extent and functional significance of self-association of full-length Yan remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that full-length Yan self associates via its SAM domain to form higher-order complexes in living cells. Introduction of SAM domain missense mutations that restrict Yan to a monomeric state reduces Yan's transcriptional repression activity and impairs its function during embryonic and retinal development. Coexpression of combinations of SAM domain mutations that permit the formation of Yan dimers, but not higher-order oligomers, increases activity relative to that of monomeric Yan, but not to the level obtained with wild-type Yan. Mechanistically, self-association directly promotes transcriptional repression of target genes independent of its role in limiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear export of Yan. Thus, we propose that the formation of higher-order Yan oligomers contributes to proper repression of target gene expression and RTK signaling output in developing tissues.},

abstract = {Ever since the establishment of cell theory in the early 19th century, which recognized the cell as the fundamental building unit of life, biologists have sought to explain the underlying principles. Momentous discoveries were made over the course of many decades of research [1], but the quest to attain full understanding of cellular mechanisms and how to manipulate them to improve health continues to the present day, with bigger budgets, more minds, and more sophisticated tools than ever before. One of the tools to which a great deal of the progress in cell biology can be attributed is light microscopy [2]. The field has come a long way since Antoni van Leeuwenhoeks first steps in the 1670s toward improving and exploiting microscopic imaging for studying life at the cellular level. Not only do biologists today have a plethora of different, complementary microscopic imaging techniques at their disposal that enable them to visualize phenomena even way below the classical diffraction limit of light, advanced microscope systems also allow them to easily acquire very large numbers of images within just a matter of hours. The abundance, heterogeneity, dimensionality, and complexity of the data generated in modern imaging experiments rule out manual image management, processing, and analysis. Consequently, computerized techniques for performing these tasks have become of key importance for further progress in cell biology [3][6]. A central problem in many studies, and often regarded as the cornerstone of image analysis, is image segmentation. Specifically, since cellular morphology is an important phenotypic feature that is indicative of the physiological state of a cell, and since the cell contour is often required for subsequent analysis of intracellular processes (zooming in to nanoscale), or of cell sociology (zooming out to millimeter scale), the problem of cell segmentation has received increasing attention in past years [7]. Here we reflect on how the field has ev- lved over the years and how past developments can be expected to extrapolate into the future.},

abstract = {Glial-neuronal cell interactions at the ventral midline are necessary for the proper elaboration of commissures in the embryonic CNS of Drosophila. In particular, migrating midline glial cells are required for the separation of segmental commissures. During this process the glial cells recognize specific neuronal cells at the midline, they migrate posteriorly along their cell processes and thereby separate the segmental commissures. The gene pointed (pnt) is required for this glial-neuronal cell interaction, as loss of function mutations lead to a change in the migration behavior of the midline glial cells. As a consequence, anterior and posterior commissures do not become separated and appear fused. Molecular analysis of pointed has revealed two differently spliced types of transcripts, which are encoded in a region extending over 55 kb of genomic sequence. In the CNS both transcript classes are expressed in cells of the midline, including the midline glial cells. Sequence analysis of cDNA clones corresponding to both transcript types reveals two different pointed proteins which share an ETS domain common to a number of transcription factors related to the vertebrate ets oncogene. Furthermore, one pointed protein form contains an additional domain of homology of approx. 80 amino acids in length, which is shared by only a subset of the ETS protein family.},

abstract = {Advances in molecular biology provide various methods to define the structure and function of the individual proteins that form the component parts of subcellular structures. The ability to see the dynamic behavior of a specific protein inside the living cell became possible through the application of advanced fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscope techniques. The fluorophore molecule used for FRET imaging has a characteristic absorption and emission spectrum that should be considered for characterizing the FRET signal. In this article we describe the system development for the image acquisition for one- and two-photon excitation FRET microscopy. We also describe the precision FRET (PFRET) data analysis algorithm that we developed to remove spectral bleed-through and variation in the fluorophore expression level (or concentration) for the donor and acceptor molecules. The acquired images have been processed using a PFRET algorithm to calculate the energy transfer efficiency and the distance between donor and acceptor molecules. We implemented the software correction to study the organization of the apical endosome in epithelial polarized MDCK cells and dimerization of the CAATT/enhancer binding protein $\alpha$ (C/EBP$\alpha$). For these proteins, the results revealed that the extent of correction affects the conventionally calculated energy transfer efficiency (E) and the distance (r) between donor and acceptor molecules by 38 and 9{\%}, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Adipogenesis, or the conversion of proliferating preadipocytes into nondividing adipocytes, is an important part of the vertebrate weight-maintenance program. It is not yet understood how and when an irreversible transition occurs into a distinct state capable of accumulating lipid. Here, we use single-cell fluorescence imaging to show that an all-or-none switch is induced before lipid accumulation occurs. Conversion begins by glucocorticoid and cAMP signals raising C/EBP$\beta$ levels above a critical threshold, triggering three consecutive positive feedback loops: from PPAR$\gamma$ to C/EBP$\alpha$, then to C/EBP$\beta$, and last to the insulin receptor. Experiments and modeling show that these feedbacks create a robust, irreversible transition to a terminally differentiated state by rejecting short- and low-amplitude stimuli. After the differentiation switch is triggered, insulin controls fat accumulation in a graded fashion. Altogether, our study introduces a regulatory motif that locks cells in a differentiated state by engaging a sequence of positive feedback loops},

The relationship of size and temperature to development is of particular interest, because during ontogeny size changes and temperature often varies. Here we derive a general model, based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics, that predicts the time of ontogenetic development as a function of body mass and temperature. The model fits embryonic development times spanning a wide range of egg sizes and incubation temperatures for birds and aquatic ectotherms (fish, amphibians, aquatic insects and zooplankton). The model also describes nearly 75{\%} of the variation in post-embryonic development among a diverse sample of zooplankton. The remaining variation is partially explained by stoichiometry, specifically the whole-body carbon to phosphorus ratio. Development in other animals at other life stages is also described by this model. These results suggest a general definition of biological time that is approximately invariant and common to all organisms.},

Using PU.1-/- progenitors, we demonstrate that at subthreshold levels, this Ets transcription factor regulates a mixed pattern (macrophage/neutrophil) of gene expression within individual myeloid progenitors. Increased PU.1 levels refine the pattern and promote macrophage differentiation by modulating a novel regulatory circuit comprised of counter antagonistic repressors, Egr-1,2/Nab-2 and Gfi-1. Egr-1 and Egr-2 function redundantly to activate macrophage genes and to repress the neutrophil program.

abstract = {Multi-colour localization microscopy has enabled sub-diffraction studies of colocalization between multiple biological species and quantification of their correlation at length scales previously inaccessible with conventional fluorescence microscopy. However, bleed-through, or misidentification of probe species, creates false colocalization and artificially increases certain types of correlation between two imaged species, affecting the reliability of information provided by colocalization and quantified correlation. Despite the potential risk of these artefacts of bleed-through, neither the effect of bleed-through on correlation nor methods for its correction in correlation analyses have been systematically studied at typical rates of bleed-through reported to affect multi-colour imaging. Here, we present a reliable method of bleed-through correction applicable to image rendering and correlation analysis of multi-colour localization microscopy. Application of our bleed-through correction shows that our method accurately corrects the artificial increase in both types of correlation studied (Pearson coefficient and pair correlation), at all rates of bleed-through tested, in all types of correlation examined. In particular, anti-correlation could not be quantified without our bleed-through correction, even at rates of bleed-through as low as 2{\%}. While it is demonstrated with dichroic-based multi-colour FPALM here, our presented method of bleed-through correction can be applied to all types of localization microscopy (PALM, STORM, dSTORM, GSDIM, etc), including both simultaneous and sequential multi-colour modalities, provided the rate of bleed-through can be reliably determined.},

abstract = {Cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) are defined by unique combinations of transcription factor-binding sites. Emerging evidence suggests that the number, affinity, and organization of sites play important roles in regulating enhancer output and, ultimately, gene expression. Here, we investigate how the cis-regulatory logic of a tissue-specific CRM responsible for even-skipped (eve) induction during cardiogenesis organizes the competing inputs of two E-twenty-six (ETS) members: the activator Pointed (Pnt) and the repressor Yan. Using a combination of reporter gene assays and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we suggest that Yan and Pnt have distinct syntax preferences. Not only does Yan prefer high-affinity sites, but an overlapping pair of such sites is necessary and sufficient for Yan to tune Eve expression levels in newly specified cardioblasts and block ectopic Eve induction and cell fate specification in surrounding progenitors. Mechanistically, the efficient Yan recruitment promoted by this high-affinity ETS supersite not only biases Yan-Pnt competition at the specific CRM but also organizes Yan-repressive complexes in three dimensions across the eve locus. Taken together, our results uncover a novel mechanism by which differential interpretation of CRM syntax by a competing repressor-activator pair can confer both specificity and robustness to developmental transitions.},

abstract = {Studies of individual living cells have revealed that many transcription factors activate in dynamic, and often stochastic, pulses within the same cell. However, it has remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic interaction of these pulses to control gene expression. Here, using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 showed pulsed activation in either a temporally overlapping or non-overlapping manner during their transient response to different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression. Similarly, under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1 exhibit sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the temporal overlap between pulses of the two factors. Together, these results reveal a time-based mode of combinatorial gene regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results suggest that it could also function broadly within the signalling and regulatory systems of the cell.},

abstract = {Analysis of the development of Delta (Dl) temperature-sensitive mutants pulsed at restrictive temperature during larval and pupal stages reveals multiple phenocritical periods during which reduction of Dl function affects viability and development of adult structures. Dl function is required during the third larval instar for post-pupal viability and during the first day of pupal development for viability through eclosion. Dl function is required biphasically for the development of sensory bristles. Earlier pulses lead to bristle multiplication and later pulses lead to bristle loss. The exact intervals during which multiplication and loss are induced vary for different bristles. Dl function is also required for development of most, if not all, cell types in the retina. Different pulses result in reduction in eye size, scarring, and glossiness, as well as multiplication and loss of interommatidial bristles. We also define intervals during which Dl function is required for aspects of leg and wing development. Phenocritical periods for Dl function are temporally coincident with those previously reported for Notch (N), consistent with the hypothesis that the proteins encoded by Dl and N interact throughout development to assure correct specification of cell fates in a variety of imaginal tissues.

abstract = {Cell–cell signaling is subject to variability in the extracellular volume, cell number, and dilution that potentially increase uncertainty in the absolute concentrations of the extracellular signaling molecules. To direct cell aggregation, the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum collectively give rise to oscillations and waves of cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) under a wide range of cell density. To date, the systems-level mechanism underlying the robustness is unclear. By using quantitative live-cell imaging, here we show that the magnitude of the cAMP relay response of individual cells is determined by fold change in the extracellular cAMP concentrations. The range of cell density and exogenous cAMP concentrations that support oscillations at the population level agrees well with conditions that support a large fold-change–dependent response at the single-cell level. Mathematical analysis suggests that invariance of the oscillations to density transformation is a natural outcome of combining secrete-and-sense systems with a fold-change detection mechanism.},

abstract = {Cells must reliably respond to changes in transcription factor levels in order to execute cell state transitions in the correct time and place. These transitions are typically thought to be triggered by changes in the absolute nuclear concentrations of relevant transcription factors. We have identified a developmental context in which cell fate transitions depend on changes in the relative concentrations of two transcription factors. Here, we quantify the in vivo expression dynamics of Yan and Pointed, two essential E-twenty-six (ETS) proteins that regulate transcription during eye development in Drosophila. These two factors exert opposing influences; one impedes transcription of gene targets required for differentiation while the other promotes it. We show that both proteins are transiently co-expressed in eye progenitor cells and also during photoreceptor specification. To decide whether to undergo state transitions, cells respond to the ratio of the two protein concentrations rather than changes in the absolute abundance of either transcription factor. We show that a simple model based on the statistical physics of protein-DNA binding illustrates how this ratiometric sensing of transcription factor concentrations could occur. Gene dosage experiments reveal that progenitor cells stabilize the ratio against fluctuations in the absolute concentration of either protein. We further show that signaling inputs via the Notch and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) pathways set the ratio in progenitor cells, priming them for either transit to differentiation or for continued multipotency. A sustained change in the ratio accompanies the transit to differentiation This novel mechanism allows for distributed control of developmental transitions by multiple transcription factors, making the system robust to fluctuating genetic or environmental conditions.},

@article{Morimoto1996,
abstract = {Spatially regulated activation of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor by its ligand, Gurken, is required for establishment of the dorsal/ventral axis of the oocyte and embryo. During mid-oogenesis, Gurken is concentrated at the dorsal-anterior of the oocyte and is thought to activate the EGF receptor pathway in adjacent follicle cells. In response to this signal, dorsal follicle cell fate is determined. These cells further differentiate into either appendage-producing or midline cells, resulting in patterning in the dorsal follicle cell layer. We show here that Pointed, an ETS transcription factor, is required in dorsal follicle cells for this patterning. Loss of pointed results in the loss of midline cells and an excess of appendage-forming cells, a phenotype associated with overactivation of the EGF receptor pathway in the dorsal region. Overexpression of pointed leads to a phenotype similar to that generated by loss of the EGF receptor pathway. This suggests that Pointed normally down-regulates EGF receptor signaling in the midline to generate patterning in the dorsal region. Interestingly, pointed expression is induced by the EGF receptor pathway. These data indicate a novel antagonistic function for Pointed in oogenesis; in response to activation of the EGF receptor, pointed is expressed and negatively regulates the EGF receptor pathway, possibly by integrating information from a second pathway.},

A cell-by-cell analysis reveals details of these events. Early stages of ommatidial assembly can be resolved using a lead sulfide stain. Overt ommatidial organization begins in the morphogenetic furrow as cells gather into periodically spaced concentric aggregates. A stereotyped sequence of cell rearrangements converts these aggregates into preclusters. In the furrow, new rows of ommatidia are initiated at the equator and grow as new clusters are added to the peripheral ends. Mitotic labeling using BrdU feeds shows that all cells not incorporated into a precluster divide. BrdU injections show that cells divide roughly simultaneously between two adjacent rows of ommatidia.},

The Drosophila eye comprises ∼750 units, whose crystalline order is set during differentiation of the eye imaginal disc: an activation wave sweeping across the disc is coupled to lateral inhibition, sequentially selecting pro-neural cells. Using mathematical modelling, here we show that this template-based lateral inhibition is highly sensitive to spatial variations in biochemical parameters and cell sizes. We reveal the basis of this sensitivity, and suggest that it can be overcome by assuming a short-range diffusible activator. Clonal experiments identify Scabrous, a previously implicated inhibitor, as the predicted activator.

A bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) morphogen gradient plays a key role in embryonic development, and we are beginning to understand how the self-regulating properties of its signaling circuitry ensure robust embryonic patterning. An unexplored question is why the BMP signaling circuit is organized as a modular synexpression group, with a prevalence of feedback inhibitors. Here, we provide evidence from direct experimentation and mathematical modeling that the synexpressed feedback inhibitors BAMBI, SMAD6, and SMAD7 (i) expand the dynamic BMP signaling range essential for proper embryonic patterning and (ii) reduce interindividual phenotypic and molecular variability in Xenopus embryos. Thereby, negative feedback linearizes signaling responses and confers robust patterning, thus promoting canalized development. The presence of negative feedback inhibitors in other growth factor synexpression groups suggests that these properties may constitute a general principle.},

abstract = {Many real-world networks are so large that we must simplify their structure before we can extract useful information about the systems they represent. As the tools for doing these simplifications proliferate within the network literature, researchers would benefit from some guidelines about which of the so-called community detection algorithms are most appropriate for the structures they are studying and the questions they are asking. Here we show that different methods highlight different aspects of a network's structure and that the the sort of information that we seek to extract about the system must guide us in our decision. For example, many community detection algorithms, including the popular modularity maximization approach, infer module assignments from an underlying model of the network formation process. However, we are not always as interested in how a system's network structure was formed, as we are in how a network's extant structure influences the system's behavior. To see how structure influences current behavior, we will recognize that links in a network induce movement across the network and result in system-wide interdependence. In doing so, we explicitly acknowledge that most networks carry flow. To highlight and simplify the network structure with respect to this flow, we use the map equation. We present an intuitive derivation of this flow-based and information-theoretic method and provide an interactive on-line application that anyone can use to explore the mechanics of the map equation. We also describe an algorithm and provide source code to efficiently decompose large weighted and directed networks based on the map equation.},

abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy of FRET-based biosensors allow nanoscale interactions to be probed in living cells. This paper describes a novel approach to spectrally resolved fluorescence microscopy, termed sensorFRET, that enables quantitative measurement of FRET efficiency. This approach is an improvement on existing methods (FLIM, sRET, luxFRET, pFRET), as it does not require single fluorophore standards to be measured with every experiment and the acquisition is intensity independent, allowing the laser power to be optimized for varying levels of fluorophore expression. Additionally, it was found that all spectral based methods, including sensorFRET, fail at specific fluorophore-excitation wavelength combinations. These combinations can be determined a priori using sensorFRET, whereas other methods would give no indication of inaccuracies. This method was thoroughly validated and compared to existing methods using simulated spectra, Fluorescein and TAMRA dye mixtures as a zero FRET control, and Cerulean-Venus FRET standards as positive FRET controls. Simulations also provided a means of quantifying the uncertainty in each measurement by relating the fit residual of noisy spectra to the standard deviation of the measured FRET efficiency. As an example application, Teal-Venus force sensitive biosensors integrated into E-cadherin were used to resolve piconewton scale forces along different parts of an individual cell junction.},

At higher resolution, observation of the constituent photoreceptors, cone cells, and pigment cells of the eye reveals a highly ordered mosaic of amazing regularity. This relatively simple organization belies the repeated requirement for spatially and temporally coordinated inputs from the Hedgehog (Hh), Wingless (Wg), Decapentaplegic (Dpp), JAK-STAT, Notch, and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. This review will discuss how signaling inputs from the Notch and RTK pathways, superimposed on the developmental history of a cell, facilitate context-specific and appropriate cell fate specification decisions in the developing fly eye. Lessons learned from investigating the combinatorial signal integration strategies underlying Drosophila eye development will likely reveal cell–cell communication paradigms relevant to many aspects of invertebrate and mammalian development.

abstract = {Transcription factors use both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions to assemble appropriate complexes to regulate gene expression. Although most transcription factors operate as monomers or dimers, a few, including the E26 transformation-specific family repressors Drosophila melanogaster Yan and its human homolog TEL/ETV6, can polymerize. Although polymerization is required for both the normal and oncogenic function of Yan and TEL/ETV6, the mechanisms by which it influences the recruitment, organization, and stability of transcriptional complexes remain poorly understood. Further, a quantitative description of the DNA occupancy of a polymerizing transcription factor is lacking, and such a description would have broader applications to the conceptually related area of polymerizing chromatin regulators. To expand the theoretical basis for understanding how the oligomeric state of a transcriptional regulator influences its chromatin occupancy and function, we leveraged the extensive biochemical characterization of E26 transformation-specific factors to develop a mathematical model of Yan occupancy at chemical equilibrium. We find that spreading condensation from a specific binding site can take place in a path-independent manner given reasonable values of the free energies of specific and non-specific DNA binding and protein-protein cooperativity. Our calculations show that polymerization confers upon a transcription factor the unique ability to extend occupancy across DNA regions far from specific binding sites. In contrast, dimerization promotes recruitment to clustered binding sites and maximizes discrimination between specific and non-specific sites. We speculate that the association with non-specific DNA afforded by polymerization may enable regulatory behaviors that are well-suited to transcriptional repressors but perhaps incompatible with precise activation.},

abstract = {We studied the relationship between growth rate and genome-wide gene expression, cell cycle progression, and glucose metabolism in 36 steady-state continuous cultures limited by one of six different nutrients (glucose, ammonium, sulfate, phosphate, uracil, or leucine). The expression of more than one quarter of all yeast genes is linearly correlated with growth rate, independent of the limiting nutrient. The subset of negatively growth-correlated genes is most enriched for peroxisomal functions, whereas positively correlated genes mainly encode ribosomal functions. Many (not all) genes associated with stress response are strongly correlated with growth rate, as are genes that are periodically expressed under conditions of metabolic cycling. We confirmed a linear relationship between growth rate and the fraction of the cell population in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase, independent of limiting nutrient. Cultures limited by auxotrophic requirements wasted excess glucose, whereas those limited on phosphate, sulfate, or ammonia did not; this phenomenon (reminiscent of the "Warburg effect" in cancer cells) was confirmed in batch cultures. Using an aggregate of gene expression values, we predict (in both continuous and batch cultures) an "instantaneous growth rate." This concept is useful in interpreting the system-level connections among growth rate, metabolism, stress, and the cell cycle.},

We reduced Notch activity at successive intervals during development of the retina, and then examined the effect on individual cells. When Notch activity was reduced, cells responded by selecting inappropriate developmental pathways. We found that all cell types appear to require Notch when establishing their fate. To examine further Notch's role in eye development, we examined two alleles of Notch--split and facet-glossy. split flies show defects in the initial clustering of photoreceptors, whereas the defects in facet-glossy flies are due to the misrouting of presumptive primary pigment cells into the secondary pigment cell pathway. Our results suggest that Notch plays a permissive role in the cell-cell interactions used to assemble the eye.},

abstract = {Background: Intercellular signals are major determinants of cell fate during development. Certain signals and receptors are important for many different cell-fate decisions, suggesting that cellular responses to similar signals change during development. Few transitions between such distinct cellular responses have been studied. The Drosophila genes Notch and hedgehog function during intracellular signaling at various stages of development. In the specific case of development of the Drosophila eye, expression of the proneural gene atonal is induced in response to Hedgehog signaling and then becomes subject to autoregulation. The receptor protein Notch has previously been reported to function in the selection of single founder photoreceptor cells (R8 cells) by inhibiting atonal expression. On this basis, complete elimination of Notch gene function would be expected to cause neural hyperplasia in the eye. Results: Contrary to expectation, we detect a reduction in neural differentiation both in cells expressing a conditional Notch allele and in those lacking expression of either Notch or its ligand Delta. We show here that Notch signaling acts after the initial Hedgehog-driven expression of atonal to enhance proneural competence of the atonal-expressing cells and also to terminate their response to the Hedgehog signals. This occurs before the Notch induced lateral inhibition of atonal expression within the same cells. Conclusions: Notch has sequentially opposite effects on the same cells, by first promoting and then inhibiting proneural gene function. This apparently paradoxical sequence of events has two possible consequences. Firstly, coupling of alternative cellular responses to the same receptor may prevent them from occurring simultaneously. Secondly, consecutive regulatory processes become temporally coupled, so that these events follow on from each other, without gaps or overlaps.},

Drosophila border cells represent a powerful model for addressing this issue and to specifically decipher the mechanisms controlling collective cell migration. Here, we identify the Drosophila Insulin/Insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) pathway as a key regulator in controlling actin dynamics in border cells, independently of its function in growth control. Loss of IIS activity blocks the formation of actin-rich long cellular extensions that are important for the delamination and the migration of the invasive cluster. We show that IIS specifically activates the expression of the actin regulator chickadee, the Drosophila homolog of Profilin, which is essential for promoting the formation of actin extensions and migration through the egg chamber. In this process, the transcription factor FoxO acts as a repressor of chickadee expression. Altogether, these results show that local activation of IIS controls collective cell migration through regulation of actin homeostasis and protrusion dynamics.},

abstract = {How signaling pathways function reliably despite cellular variation remains a question in many systems. In the transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (Tgf-$\beta$) pathway, exposure to ligand stimulates nuclear localization of Smad proteins, which then regulate target gene expression. Examining Smad3 dynamics in live reporter cells, we found evidence for fold-change detection. Although the level of nuclear Smad3 varied across cells, the fold change in the level of nuclear Smad3 was a more precise outcome of ligand stimulation. The precision of the fold-change response was observed throughout the signaling duration and across Tgf-$\beta$ doses, and significantly increased the information transduction capacity of the pathway. Using single-molecule FISH, we further observed that expression of Smad3 target genes (ctgf,snai1, andwnt9a) correlated more strongly with the fold change, rather than the level, of nuclear Smad3. These findings suggest that some target genes sense Smad3 level relative to background, as a strategy for coping with cellular noise.},

abstract = {Cells exhibit a high degree of variation in levels of gene expression, even within otherwise homogeneous populations. The standard model to describe this variation centres on a gamma distribution driven by stochastic bursts of translation. Stochastic bursting, however, cannot account for the well-established behaviour of strong transcriptional repressors. Instead, it can be shown that the very complexity of the biochemical processes involved in gene expression drives an emergent log-normal distribution of expression levels. Emergent log-normal distributions can account for the observed behaviour of transcriptional repressors, are still compatible with stochastically constrained distributions, and have important implications for both analysis of gene expression data and the engineering of biological organisms. 1},

abstract = {The restriction point (R-point) marks the critical event when a mammalian cell commits to proliferation and becomes independent of growth stimulation. It is fundamental for normal differentiation and tissue homeostasis, and seems to be dysregulated in virtually all cancers. Although the R-point has been linked to various activities involved in the regulation of G1-S transition of the mammalian cell cycle, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Using single-cell measurements, we show here that the Rb-E2F pathway functions as a bistable switch to convert graded serum inputs into all-or-none E2F responses. Once turned ON by sufficient serum stimulation, E2F can memorize and maintain this ON state independently of continuous serum stimulation. We further show that, at critical concentrations and duration of serum stimulation, bistable E2F activation correlates directly with the ability of a cell to traverse the R-point.},

abstract = {A small pool of neural progenitors generates the vast diversity of cell types in the CNS. Spatial patterning specifies progenitor identity, followed by temporal patterning within progenitor lineages to expand neural diversity. Recent work has shown that in Drosophila, all neural progenitors (neuroblasts) sequentially express temporal transcription factors (TTFs) that generate molecular and cellular diversity. Embryonic neuroblasts use a lineage-intrinsic cascade of five TTFs that switch nearly every neuroblast cell division; larval optic lobe neuroblasts also use a rapid cascade of five TTFs, but the factors are completely different. In contrast, larval central brain neuroblasts undergo a major molecular transition midway through larval life, and this transition is regulated by a lineage-extrinsic cue (ecdysone hormone signaling). Overall, every neuroblast lineage uses a TTF cascade to generate diversity, illustrating the widespread importance of temporal patterning.},

Recently, the Cre/loxP system has been applied to induce mitotic recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells and in many adult mouse tissues. We have used this strategy to generate a previously undescribed p53 mouse model in which expression of a ubiquitously expressed recombinase in a heterozygous p53 knockout animal produces mitotic recombinant clones homozygous for the p53 mutation. The induction of loss of heterozygosity in a few cells in an otherwise normal tissue mimics genetic aspects of tumorigenesis more closely than existing models and has revealed the possible cell autonomous nature of Wnt3. Our results suggest that inducible mitotic recombination can be used for clonal analysis of mutants in the mouse.},

Extra macrochaetae (Emc) forms inactive heterodimers with both proneural bHLH proteins and their bHLH partners (represented in Drosophila by Daughterless). It is generally thought that varying levels of Emc define a prepattern that determines where proneural bHLH genes can be effective. We report that instead it is the bHLH proteins that determine the pattern of Emc levels. Daughterless level sets Emc protein levels in most cells, apparently by stabilizing Emc in heterodimers. Emc is destabilized in proneural regions by local competition for heterodimer formation by proneural bHLH proteins including Atonal or AS-C proteins. Reflecting this post-translational control through protein stability, uniform emc transcription is sufficient for almost normal patterns of neurogenesis. Protein stability regulated by exchanges between bHLH protein dimers could be a feature of bHLH-mediated developmental events.},

Under the present experimental conditions, precursors of receptor cells give rise to about 8 elements which differentiate as R cells of two different groups. One of the cells differentiates as R7 and the remaining as any one of the R1 to R6. The last cells behave initially as equivalent, and can differentiate within the same or within different, but neighbouring, ommatidia. The class of R1 to R6 cell in which each one of these elements differentiates, seems to depend on the time of its origin.

Among 21 newly induced Notch alleles, about one-half are temperature-conditional for some effects, and three are temperature-sensitive for viability. One temperature-sensitive lethal, l(1)Nts1, is functionally non-complementing for all known effects of Notch locus mutations and maps at a single site within the locus. Among the existing alleles involved in complex patterns of interallelic complementation, Ax59d5 is found to be temperature-sensitive, while fag, spl, and l(1)N are temperature-independent. Whereas temperature-sensitive alleles map predominantly to the right-most fifth of the locus, fag, spl, and l(1)N are known to map to the left of this region. Temperature-shift experiments demonstrate that fag, spl, and l(1)N cause defects at specific, non-overlapping times in development.—We conclude (1) that the Notch locus is a single cistron (responsible for a single functional molecule, presumably a polypeptide); (2) that the right-most fifth of the locus is, at least in part, the region involved in coding for the Notch product; (3) that the complexity of interallelic complementation is a developmental effect of mutations that cause defects at selected times and spaces, and that complementation occurs because the mutant defects are temporally and spatially non-overlapping; and (4) that mutants express selected defects due to critical temporal and spatial differences in the chemical conditions controlling the synthesis or function of the Notch product. The complexity of the locus appears to reside in controlling the expression (synthesis or function) of the Notch product in development.},

abstract = {How signal transduction, which is dynamic and fluctuating by nature, is converted into a stable trancriptional response, is an unanswered question in developmental biology. Two ETS-domain transcription factors encoded by the pointed (pnt) locus, PntP1 and PntP2, are universal downstream mediators of EGFR-based signaling in Drosophila. Full disruption of pnt function in developing eye imaginal discs reveals a photoreceptor recruitment phenotype, in which only the R8 photoreceptor cell type is specified within ommatidia. Specific disruption of either pntP1 or pntP2 resulted in the same R8-only phenotype, demonstrating that both Pnt isoforms are essential for photoreceptor recruitment. We show that the two Pnt protein forms are activated in a sequential manner within the EGFR signaling pathway: MAPK phosphorylates and activates PntP2, which in turn induces pntP1 transcription. Once expressed, PntP1 is constitutively active and sufficient to induce target genes essential for photoreceptor development. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that PntP1 is stable for several hours in the eye disc. Sequential ETS-protein recruitment therefore allows sustained induction of target genes, beyond the transient activation of EGFR},

The timing of this epoch is consistent with cell death as the last fate to be specified in the progressive sequence of cell fates that build the ommatidium. An ultrastructural survey of cell death suggests dying cells in the fly eye have similarities as well as differences with standard descriptions of programmed cell death. A failure of cell death to remove surplus cells disorganizes the retinal lattice. A screen of rough eye mutants identifies two genes, roughest and echinus, required for the normal elimination of cells from the retinal epithelium. The use of an enhancer trap as a cell lineage marker shows that the cone cells, like other retinal cells, are not clonally related to each other or to their neighbors.},

abstract = {Translating a graded morphogen distribution into tight response borders is central to all developmental processes. Yet, the molecular mechanisms generating such behavior are poorly understood. During patterning of the Drosophila embryonic ventral ectoderm, a graded mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation is converted into an all-or-none degradation switch of the Yan transcriptional repressor. Replacing the cardinal phosphorylated amino acid of Yan by a phosphomimetic residue allowed its degradation in a MAPK-independent manner, consistent with Yan phosphorylation being the critical event in generating the switch. Several alternative threshold mechanisms that could, in principle, be realized by this phosphorylation, including first order, cooperativity, positive feedback and zero-order ultrasensitivity, were analyzed. We found that they can be distinguished by their kinetics and steady-state responses to Yan overexpression. In agreement with the predictions for zero-order kinetics, an increase in Yan levels did not shift the degradation border, but significantly elevated the time required to reach steady state. We propose that a reversible loop of Yan phosphorylation implements a zero-order ultrasensitivity-like threshold mechanism, with the capacity to form sharp thresholds that are independent of the level of Yan.},

abstract = {Dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (dcFCCS) allows one to quantitatively assess the interactions of mobile molecules labeled with distinct fluorophores. The technique is widely applied to both reconstituted and live-cell biological systems. A major drawback of dcFCCS is the risk of an artifactual false-positive or overestimated cross-correlation amplitude arising from spectral cross-talk. Cross-talk can be reduced or prevented by fast alternating excitation, but the technology is not easily implemented in standard commercial setups. An experimental strategy is devised that does not require specialized hardware and software for recognizing and correcting for cross-talk in standard dcFCCS. The dependence of the cross-talk on particle concentrations and brightnesses is quantitatively confirmed. Moreover, it is straightforward to quantitatively correct for cross-talk using quickly accessible parameters, that is, the measured (apparent) fluorescence count rates and correlation amplitudes. Only the bleed-through ratio needs to be determined in a calibration measurement. Finally, the limitations of cross-talk correction and its influence on experimental error are explored.},

abstract = {In the fruit fly Drosophila, four insulin genes are coexpressed in small clusters of cells [insulin-producing cells (IPCs)] in the brain. Here, we show that ablation of these IPCs causes developmental delay, growth retardation, and elevated carbohydrate levels in larval hemolymph. All of the defects were reversed by ectopic expression of a Drosophila insulin transgene. On the basis of these functional data and the observation that IPCs release insulin into the circulatory system, we conclude that brain IPCs are the main systemic supply of insulin during larval growth. We propose that IPCs and pancreatic islet beta cells are functionally analogous and may have evolved from a common ancestral insulin-producing neuron. Interestingly, the phenotype of flies lacking IPCs includes certain features of diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {Cell fate during development is defined by transcription factors that act as molecular switches to activate or repress specific gene expression programmes. The POU transcription factor Oct-3/4 (encoded by Pou5f1) is a candidate regulator in pluripotent and germline cells and is essential for the initial formation of a pluripotent founder cell population in the mammalian embryo. Here we use conditional expression and repression in embryonic stem (ES) cells to determine requirements for Oct-3/4 in the maintenance of developmental potency. Although transcriptional determination has usually been considered as a binary on-off control system, we found that the precise level of Oct-3/4 governs three distinct fates of ES cells. A less than twofold increase in expression causes differentiation into primitive endoderm and mesoderm. In contrast, repression of Oct-3/4 induces loss of pluripotency and dedifferentiation to trophectoderm. Thus a critical amount of Oct-3/4 is required to sustain stem-cell self-renewal, and up- or downregulation induce divergent developmental programmes. Our findings establish a role for Oct-3/4 as a master regulator of pluripotency that controls lineage commitment and illustrate the sophistication of critical transcriptional regulators and the consequent importance of quantitative analyses.},

abstract = {The Notch locus of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a 2,703-amino-acid transmembrane protein required for a variety of developmental processes, including neurogenesis, oogenesis and ommatidial assembly. The Notch protein contains a large extracellular domain of 36 epidermal growth factor-like repeats as well as three Notch/Lin-12 repeats and an intracellular domain with 6 Cdc10/ankyrin repeats, motifs that are highly conserved in several vertebrate Notch homologues. Truncation of the extracellular domain of the Drosophila Notch protein produces an activated receptor, as judged by its ability to cause phenotypes similar to gain-of-function alleles of duplications of the Notch locus. Equivalent truncations of vertebrate Notch-related proteins have been associated with malignant neoplasma and other developmental abnormalities. We present here an analysis of activated Notch function at single-cell resolution in the Drosophila compound eye. We find that overexpression of full-length Notch in defined cell types has no apparent effects but that overexpression of activated Notch in the same cells transiently blocks their proper cell-fate commitment, causing them either to adopt incorrect cell fates or to differentiate incompletely. Moreover, an activated Notch protein lacking the transmembrane domain is translocated to the nucleus, raising the possibility that Notch may participate directly in nuclear events.},

Labeled homozygous mutant cells can be generated in an otherwise unlabeled heterozygous animal. Mutant or wild-type labeled cells can also be made to express one or more transgenes. Major applications of MARCM include (i) lineage analysis, (ii) investigating gene function in single or small populations of cells and (iii) neuronal circuit tracing. Our laboratory uses MARCM primarily to label and genetically manipulate neurons; however, this protocol can be adapted to any cell of interest. The protocol involves generating two fly stocks with the necessary genetic elements for MARCM analysis and subsequently generating MARCM clones. Labeled clones can be followed in live and fixed tissues for high-resolution analysis of wild-type or genetically manipulated cells.NOTE: In the PDF version of this article initially published online, the first "FRT" and the "Mutation" labels in Figure 1b were transposed.

In particular, the Cre (cyclization recombination) and FLP (flipase) enzymes are widely used to either activate or inactivate genes in a precise spatiotemporal manner. Both recombinases work efficiently in the popular model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, but their use in this nematode is still only sporadic. To increase the utility of the FLP system in C. elegans, we have generated a series of single-copy transgenic strains that stably express an optimized version of FLP in specific tissues or by heat induction. We show that recombination efficiencies reach 100{\%} in several cell types, such as muscles, intestine, and serotonin-producing neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate that most promoters drive recombination exclusively in the expected tissues. As examples of the potentials of the FLP lines, we describe novel tools for induced cell ablation by expression of the PEEL-1 toxin and a versatile FLP-out cassette for generation of GFP-tagged conditional knockout alleles. Together with other recombinase-based reagents created by the C. elegans community, this toolkit increases the possibilities for detailed analyses of specific biological processes at developmental stages inside intact animals.},

A wide range of software is available—from commercial to academic, special-purpose to Swiss army knife, small to large—but a key characteristic of software that is suitable for scientific inquiry is its accessibility. Open-source software is ideal for scientific endeavors because it can be freely inspected, modified, and redistributed; in particular, the open-software platform ImageJ has had a huge impact on the life sciences, and continues to do so. From its inception, ImageJ has grown significantly due largely to being freely available and its vibrant and helpful user community. Scientists as diverse as interested hobbyists, technical assistants, students, scientific staff, and advanced biology researchers use ImageJ on a daily basis, and exchange knowledge via its dedicated mailing list. Uses of ImageJ range from data visualization and teaching to advanced image processing and statistical analysis. The software's extensibility continues to attract biologists at all career stages as well as computer scientists who wish to effectively implement specific image-processing algorithms. In this review, we use the ImageJ project as a case study of how open-source software fosters its suites of software tools, making multitudes of image-analysis technology easily accessible to the scientific community. We specifically explore what makes ImageJ so popular, how it impacts the life sciences, how it inspires other projects, and how it is self-influenced by coevolving projects within the ImageJ ecosystem.

@article{Helmuth2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sub-cellular structures interact in numerous direct and indirect ways in order to fulfill cellular functions. While direct molecular interactions crucially depend on spatial proximity, other interactions typically result in spatial correlations between the interacting structures. Such correlations are the target of microscopy-based co-localization analysis, which can provide hints of potential interactions. Two complementary approaches to co-localization analysis can be distinguished: intensity correlation methods capitalize on pattern discovery, whereas object-based methods emphasize detection power. RESULTS: We first reinvestigate the classical co-localization measure in the context of spatial point pattern analysis. This allows us to unravel the set of implicit assumptions inherent to this measure and to identify potential confounding factors commonly ignored. We generalize object-based co-localization analysis to a statistical framework involving spatial point processes. In this framework, interactions are understood as position co-dependencies in the observed localization patterns. The framework is based on a model of effective pairwise interaction potentials and the specification of a null hypothesis for the expected pattern in the absence of interaction. Inferred interaction potentials thus reflect all significant effects that are not explained by the null hypothesis. Our model enables the use of a wealth of well-known statistical methods for analyzing experimental data, as demonstrated on synthetic data and in a case study considering virus entry into live cells. We show that the classical co-localization measure typically under-exploits the information contained in our data. CONCLUSIONS: We establish a connection between co-localization and spatial interaction of sub-cellular structures by formulating the object-based interaction analysis problem in a spatial statistics framework based on nearest-neighbor distance distributions. We provide generic procedures for inferring interaction strengths and quantifying their relative statistical significance from sets of discrete objects as provided by image analysis methods. Within our framework, an interaction potential can either refer to a phenomenological or a mechanistic model of a physico-chemical interaction process. This increased flexibility in designing and testing different hypothetical interaction models can be used to quantify the parameters of a specific interaction model or may catalyze the discovery of functional relations.},
