\subsection{Data and software availability}

We have distributed the automated mosaic analysis framework as an open-source python package available at \url{https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/clones}. We also intend to incorporate its core features into future version of \emph{FlyEye Silhouette}, our open-source platform for quantitative analysis of the larval eye. The code used to generate synthetic microscopy data is also freely available at \url{https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/growth}. All segmented and annotated eye discs are accessible via our data repository. These include a series of Jupyter notebooks that enable complete reproduction of all figures and analysis presented in this manuscript.



\textbf{Data and software availability}

All segmented and annotated eye discs are available in our data repository: \url{https://arch.library.northwestern.edu/concern/generic_works/vm40xr737?locale=en}. The \emph{FlyEye Silhouette} software is freely available via the macOS App Store. All subsequent expression analysis and visualization procedures, our transcription factor binding model, and clones analysis pipeline are available as open-source Python packages.
